    value: The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FBC/20200901/DebtAndEquities/CreditEvents.rdf version of this ontology
      was revised to move a restriction involving breach of covenant from credit event, since not all credit events involve
      breaches, to default event, and loosen the constraint since a breach depends on the contract.

These include credit events relating to a specific debt obligation and events relating to the business entity as a whole.  		Note: the events defined herein are primarily business rather than consumer oriented, and are specified fairly generally. Many credit events are jurisdiction-specific, such as Chapter 11 restructuring and Chapter 7 bankruptcy in the United States. This ontology is designed to facilitate jurisdiction and instrument-specific extensions as needed.
