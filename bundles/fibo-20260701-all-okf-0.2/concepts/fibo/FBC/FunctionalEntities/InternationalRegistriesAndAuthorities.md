    value: This ontology extends the Business Registries ontology to define commonly referenced international registration
      authorities and related registry details, where the multi-national responsibilities for registering and/or managing
      various identifiers needed in banking applications occur, such as SWIFT. These individuals and in some cases, such as
      registry entries, are managed independently to reduce the import footprint for applications that do not require them,
      in other words, to support modularity needs of FIBO users.
