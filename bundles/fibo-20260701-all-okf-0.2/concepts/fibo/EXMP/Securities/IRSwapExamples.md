  - predicate: http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#changeNote
    value: The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/20200601/Securities/IRSwapExamples.rdf version of this ontology
      was revised to replace uses of hasTag in Relations with hasTag from LCC, as the more complex union of datatypes in the
      Relations concept is not needed here.

    value: The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/20200701/Securities/IRSwapExamples.rdf version of this ontology
      was modified to move the property 'exchanges' to FND given that it could be applied more generally than with respect
      to swaps only.

    value: The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/20210101/Securities/IRSwapExamples.rdf version of this ontology

    value: The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/20230201/Securities/IRSwapExamples.rdf version of this ontology
      was modified to use the Commons Ontology Library (Commons) rather than the OMG's Languages, Countries and Codes (LCC)
      and to eliminate redundancies in FIBO as appropriate.

    value: The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/20250301/Securities/IRSwapExamples.rdf version of the ontology
      was modified to move examples from their original locations to the EXMP module (FND-407), reflect the move of the definition
      of portfolio to FND ownership (SEC-219), and use Commons 1.3 properties rather than deprectated properties from FND
      (FND-412).
