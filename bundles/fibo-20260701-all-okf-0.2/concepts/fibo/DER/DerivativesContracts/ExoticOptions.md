    value: This ontology covers exotic options, a category of options contracts that differ from traditional options in their
      payment structures, expiration dates, and strike prices. The underlying asset or security can vary with exotic options
      allowing for more investment alternatives. Exotic options are hybrid securities that are often customizable to the needs
      of the investor, and most are traded over the counter (OTC).

    value: The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/20220801/DerivativesContracts/ExoticOptions/ version of this

    value: The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/20221201/DerivativesContracts/ExoticOptions.rdf version of this
      ontology was modified to add a definition for European options, such as LEPOs, to use the Commons Ontology Library (Commons)
      Annotation Vocabulary rather than the OMG's Specification Metadata vocabulary, and to move the definition of an underlier
      and the related property, has underlier, to financial instruments so that these concepts are also available for use
      in relation to pool-backed securities.

      ontology was modified to move the property, 'is conferred on' to the Legal Capacity ontology and to use the Commons
      Ontology Library (Commons) rather than the OMG's Languages, Countries and Codes (LCC), eliminating redundancies in FIBO
