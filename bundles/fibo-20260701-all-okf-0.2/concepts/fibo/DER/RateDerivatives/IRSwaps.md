    value: The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/20200701/RateDerivatives/IRSwaps/ version of this ontology was
      modified take advantage of basic fixed and floating legs as higher level concepts common to many swaps, and to refine

      and augment this ontology to include both OIS and zero coupon swaps to facilitate mapping to the CFI standard as well
